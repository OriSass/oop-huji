Question 10.2.4:
The manager creates: The sky, terrain, night, sun, tree's, avatar, cloud.
Each tree is actually a trunk, a list of leaves, and a list of fruit.

I used the observer design pattern for handling events that need to happen on a jump.
In the exercise's instructions only one thing happens on that occasion- rain comes down from the cloud
The JumpNotifier holds all jumpObservers, and notifies them on avatar jump
Cloud implement's JumpObserver so on avatar jump it creates rain.

Flora is responsible for creating all trees, at the beginning and in infinity mode.
Same for Terrain and ground blocks.

Block is the building block used to build the terrain and cloud.

Avatar has energy, which is boosted when he eat's a fruit.
if he moves: sideways or jumps it cost's him energy.
Also can regenerate by not moving.
